# Questions 

## 1: what is the difference between Functional components and Class components

We have a difference in the state and lifecycle, such in class components we have (componentWillMount, componentDidUpdate, etc..), and in the functional components we have useEffect hook.
Also there are a difference at the syntax like declaring components, handling state  and passing props.


## 2: rools of hooks

First we can juste call the hooks in Functional componenets ,also always we call the hooks at the top of components and can't be conditional.

## 3: how useEffect work ?

Basically, it's tell to the components to do something after rendering , also he call it later after an update.


## 4: what is props ?

It's a JS arguments, with that we can send a params to components.
